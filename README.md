=====================
This shows the slidify presentation of my application.

My application is a simple a psychometric test called the Machiavellian score, developed by in a classical paper by Christie and Geis (1970). There are several versions of the test, and the version used in the application is the Mach IV score. It consists of 20 statements, such as "Anyone who completely trusts anyone else is asking for trouble" or "it is hard to get ahead without cutting corners here and there". Survey participants are asked to agree or disagree using a 7-level Liker scale. Even in most of the scenarios when they think the statment depends on specific situations, they are asked to express an overall opinion of the general statement.

The range of the total score is from 20 to 140. Those who tend to agree with the statements score higher on the Machiavellian mindset, signalling cynicism about human nature and manipulativeness. Researchers in social sciences (pychology, economics, political science and sociology alike) often study the correlation between Machivallian characteristics and other social demographic information.

I hope the application is self-contained and easy to use. To do the test, just change the default answers to all the questions. Afterwards, click the "submit" button. Then you will see your score for each question (note: the scoring rule is reversed for questions 3,4,6,7,9,10,11,14,16,17 to aviod experimenter demand effect), as well as the total score. If you score is higher than 80, then the tendency for you to think like Machiavelli is higher than the population average. The reverse applies to those with a score lower than 80.
